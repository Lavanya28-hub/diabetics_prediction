 Input Fields Explained
These are the 7 features (after removing "Pregnancies") from the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset:

Field	Description	Typical Range
Glucose	Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)	70 â€“ 200
Blood Pressure	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)	60 â€“ 90
Skin Thickness	Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)	10 â€“ 50
Insulin	2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)	15 â€“ 276
BMI	Body Mass Index (weight/heightÂ²)	18 â€“ 40
Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF)	Genetic likelihood of diabetes	0.1 â€“ 2.5
Age	Age of the person	21 â€“ 80+

 Sample Input for a Non-Diabetic Case
You can try entering:

Glucose: 95

Blood Pressure: 72

Skin Thickness: 23

Insulin: 94

BMI: 22.0

Diabetes Pedigree Function: 0.2

Age: 29

Expected Result: You are Not Diabetic

Sample Input for a Diabetic Case
Try entering:

Glucose: 160

Blood Pressure: 88

Skin Thickness: 35

Insulin: 130

BMI: 35.0

Diabetes Pedigree Function: 1.2

Age: 50

Expected Result: You are Diabetic

ðŸ“˜ Notes on Fields:
ðŸ”¹ Glucose
Most important feature in prediction

High glucose (â‰¥140 mg/dL) after fasting is often a diabetes indicator

ðŸ”¹ BMI
â‰¥ 30 â†’ Obese

25â€“29.9 â†’ Overweight

18.5â€“24.9 â†’ Normal

ðŸ”¹ Diabetes Pedigree Function
Reflects hereditary risk

Higher = stronger family history of diabetes
